# Fake Credit Card Number Generator:

Th3Spl here!
Today i coded a new interesting program in Rust a language that i am currently learning 
so please don't judge my code :)

### Purpose:
This program will allow you to generate some FAKE credit card number with cvv obviously 
all this credit card number are fake and I don't encourage you to use them, use this only 
for educational purposes!

### How to compile it:
Firstable you have to install the rust compiler [`From Here`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
and then you have to create a new project with: cargo new projectName
then you have to open the main.rs file that you'll find in the src directory of your project and you 
have to paste the code from the file which i've uploaded.
You also have to add this in your cargo.toml file:
[dependecies]
rand = "0.8"

after that you can use cargo run in the terminal (you have to be in the same directory of your project)
and you'll be able to use the program!
